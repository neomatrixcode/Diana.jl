## Ways to contribute

### User

Using the software is a great way to contribute. Asking questions on the Julia Slack channel, Discourse, or on the GitHub repository is a great way to improve the documentation, identify bugs, request enhancements (e.g., feature requests), and let others know about the software. For example, users could bringing a new model/estimator or algorithm to my attention which could potentially be implemented.

### Contributor

Contributors are those who either contribute or review pull requests. A pull request, is a proposed change to the code base.

The process usually follows:

1. Start an issue (e.g., bug report, enhancement, question, proposal).
2. Discussion occurs in the issue and a determination is reached (e.g., a call for a pull request).
3. Someone forks the project, does the modification to the code, and submits a pull request.
4. The pull request is reviewed and any potential issues addressed before being merged if accepted.

### Notes

- A good pull request will include test coverage and documentation as relevant.

- Make sure that the pull request is based on the current master (rebase as needed).

- Any change to the code base should successfully pass the test suite.

- The code style should follow that currently being used at the base branch of the project.
